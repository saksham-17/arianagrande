      Ariana Grande-Butera was born on June 26, 1993, in Boca Raton, Florida. She is the daughter of Joan Grande, the
      Brooklyn-born CEO of Hose-McCann Communications, a manufacturer of communications and safety equipment, and
      Edward
      Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton. Grande is of Italian descent, and she refers to herself as an
      Italian American of "half Sicilian and half Abruzzese" descent. She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande,
      an
      entertainer and producer, and she has a close relationship with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande.
      Grande's
      family moved from New York to Florida when her mother was pregnant with her, and her parents separated when she
      was
      around 9 or 10 years old. As a child, Grande performed with the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater, playing her
      first role as the title character in their version of the musical Annie. She also performed in their musicals
      The
      Wizard of Oz and Beauty and the Beast.At the age of 8, she performed at a karaoke lounge on a cruise ship and
      with
      various orchestras such as South Florida's Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops and Symphonic Orchestras, and she
      made her first national television appearance singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the Florida Panthers.During
      this time she attended Florida's Pine Crest School and later North Broward Preparatory School. By age 13, she
      became
      serious about pursuing a music career, though she still concentrated on theater. When she first arrived in Los
      Angeles, California to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album: "I was like, 'I
      want
      to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B
      album?!'"
      In 2008, Grande was cast in the supporting role of cheerleader Charlotte in the musical 13 on Broadway, for
      which
      she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award. When she joined the musical, Grande left North Broward
      Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled; the school sent materials to her so she could study with
      tutors.She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club Birdland.

    <div id="indent">
      Grande was cast in the Nickelodeon television show Victorious along with 13 co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009.
      In
      this sitcom, set in a performing arts high school, Grande played the "adorably dimwitted" Cat Valentine. She had
      to
      dye her hair red every other week for the role—which severely damaged her hair—because the executive producer,
      Dan
      Schneider, did not want all the cast members to be brunettes, and the red hair was also a feature that the
      network
      felt would fit the personality of Cat. The show premiered in March 2010 to the second largest audience for a
      live-action series in Nickelodeon history with 5.7 million viewers.The role helped propel Grande to teen idol
      status, but she was more interested in a music career, stating that acting is "fun, but music has always been
      first
      and foremost with me." Her character was compared to "Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in
      Clueless"
      (1995) and described as being "very impressionable and easily swayed" but "generally sweet". The second season
      premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the highest rated episode of Victorious.In 2010, she
      played
      the role of Miriam in the musical Cuba Libre, written and produced by American songwriter Desmond Child. After
      the
      first season of Victorious wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut
      album
      in August 2010. To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro. She made her first
      musical appearance on the track "Give It Up" on the soundtrack Victorious: Music from the Hit TV Show in August
      2011. While filming Victorious, Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele,
      Whitney
      Houston and Mariah Carey, and uploaded them to YouTube. A friend of Monte Lipman, CEO of Republic Records, came
      across one of Grande's videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a
      recording
      contract. She released her first single, "Put Your Hearts Up", in December 2011, which was recorded for a
      potential
      teen-oriented pop album that was never issued. She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying
      that
      she had no interest in recording music of that genre. The song was later certified Gold by the Recording
      Industry
      Association of America (RIAA). Also in 2011, Grande voiced the fairy Princess Diaspro in 13 episodes of the
      Nickelodeon version of the Italian animated television series Winx Club, appeared in Greyson Chance's music
      video
      for the song "Unfriend You" from his album Hold On 'til the Night (2011), portraying Chance's ex-girlfriend, and
      voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film Snowflake, the White Gorilla. On
      a
      second soundtrack for Victorious, Victorious 2.0, released on June 5, 2012 as an extended play, Grande supplied
      vocals as part of the show's cast for the song "5 Fingaz to the Face". After three seasons, Victorious was not
      renewed. The finale aired in February 2013. The third and final Victorious soundtrack, Victorious 3.0, was
      released
      on November 6, 2012, featuring Grande duetting with Victoria Justice in the song "L.A. Boyz".[unreliable source]
      A
      music video of the song followed. In December 2012, Grande collaborated on the single version of "Popular Song",
      a
      duet with British singer and songwriter Mika. She also starred as Snow White in a pantomime-style musical
      theatre
      production called A Snow White Christmas, together with Charlene Tilton and Neil Patrick Harris at the Pasadena
      Playhouse. Grande played Amanda Benson in Swindle, a 2013 Nickelodeon film adaptation of the children's book of
      the
      same name. Meanwhile, Nickelodeon created Sam & Cat, an iCarly and Victorious spin-off starring Jennette McCurdy
      and
      Grande. Grande and McCurdy reprised their respective roles as Cat Valentine and Sam Puckett on the buddy sitcom,
      which paired the characters as roommates who form an after-school babysitting business. The pilot aired on June
      8,
      2013, and the show was immediately picked up by the network. The following month, Nickelodeon doubled Sam &
      Cat's
      original 20-episode order for season one, making it a 40-episode season. Despite its success in the ratings, the
      series was canceled after 35 episodes. The final episode aired on July 17, 2014.
