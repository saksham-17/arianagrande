    <div id="indent"> Grande has stated that she is hypoglycemic. She has also said that she had posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD)
      and anxiety following the Manchester Arena bombing. She commented on her social media that she almost pulled out
      of her performance in the 2018 broadcast A Very Wicked Halloween due to anxiety. Grande also stated she has been
      in therapy for over a decade, first seeing a mental health professional shortly after her parents divorced. Grande
      was raised a Roman Catholic but abandoned Catholicism during the pontificate of Benedict XVI, citing opposition to
      the church's stance on homosexuality, noting that her half-brother Frankie is gay. She has followed Kabbalah
      teachings since the age of twelve, along with Frankie, believing "the basis lies in the idea that if you're kind
      to others, good things will happen to you." A few of her songs, such as "Break Your Heart Right Back", are
      supportive of LGBT rights. In November 2019, Grande endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders' second presidential bid.
