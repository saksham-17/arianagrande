  <div id="indent">Ariana Grande-Butera (/ˌɑːriˈɑːnə ˈɡrɑːndeɪ/; born June 26, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter,
    and
    actress. Born in Boca Raton, Florida, Grande began her career in the 2008 Broadway musical 13. She rose to
    promimence for
    her role as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013) and its spin-off Sam & Cat
    (2013–2014). After she grew interested in pursuing a music career, Grande recorded songs for the soundtrack of
    Victorious, and signed with Republic Records in 2011 after the label's executives discovered videos of her
    covering songs that she uploaded onto YouTube. She released her debut album, Yours Truly, in 2013 and debuted atop
    the US
    Billboard 200. A 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B album, it spawned her first US Billboard Hot 100 top-ten
    single, "The Way".</div>
  <br>

  <div id="indent">Grande's second studio album, My Everything (2014), continued the pop-R&B sound of its predecessor
    and
    incorporated EDM elements and became her second to top the US charts. It featured four US top-ten singles:
    "Problem", "Break
    Free", "Bang Bang", and "Love Me Harder", the most of any artist that year. Her third studio album, Dangerous
    Woman (2016) continued the pop-R&B sound of its predecessor and became her first number-one album in the UK. Grande
    experimented with trap on her next albums, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019), while maintaining her
    characteristic pop-R&B tones. Both debuted at number one in multiple countries and were acclaimed by music
    critics. The former won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album and spawned the international top-three single "No
    Tears
    Left to Cry" while the latter was nominated for Album of the Year and broke several streaming records upon release.
    With the release of the singles "Thank U, Next", "7 Rings" and "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored", Grande
    became the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously and the first
    female
    artist to succeed herself at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Additionally, she is the only artist to have the
    lead singles from each of their first five studio albums debut within the top ten in the US.</div>
  <br>

  <div id="indent">Grande has received various accolades, including one Grammy Award, one Brit Award, two Billboard
    Music Awards,
    three American Music Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, and eight Guinness World Records. All five of Grande's
    full-length albums have been certified Platinum or higher by the RIAA. As one of the leading streaming pioneers in
    the world, she has amassed over 50 billion streams on platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music. She is the
    most followed female on the former two, while being the most listened to female on the latter two. An influential
    figure on social media, she is an outspoken feminist and supporter for LGBT rights.[1] In February 2019, she
    became the most followed woman on Instagram. Time named Grande as one of the 100 most influential people in the
    world in
    2016 and 2019, while Forbes has included her in the annual Forbes list of highest-earning women in music in 2019.
    Billboard recognized her as the "Woman of the Year" in 2018, and declared her the most accomplished female artist
    to debut in the 2010s.</div>
